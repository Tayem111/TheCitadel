## Subcities
### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/Aetherium\|Aetherium]]**
The centre of arcane learning, magical industry, and weird happenings. This district is where the city's wizards, alchemists, artificers, and scholars congregate. The architecture is strange, towers that defy gravity, buildings made of crystal or solidified light, and streets that sometimes change path. Magical mishaps are a daily occurrence. Or rather, it was like this. [[The Citadel/The Fall\|The Fall]] has left it less fantastical. Where magic was once used to beautify life, it is now needed for the population just to get by. 

### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/Alsace\|Alsace]]**
A combination of the tourists and travellers places and the agricultural and natural hub within the city walls. This district was dominated by massive greenhouses, terraced farms, and ranches, as well as inns, hotels and taverns. Alsace, however, did not fair well during [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]]. The [[The Citadel/Government/Military\|military]] failed to keep this area safe, and it was heavily destroyed, leaving a large part of it barren, and 'cursed', known now as [[The Citadel/Subcities/Alsace#**Ghost Town**\|Ghost Town]]. Now, Alsace fails to continue its agricultural practices, and has become ridden with crime.

### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/Bazaar\|Bazaar]]**
The bustling, chaotic, and overwhelming mercantile and trade hub. This isn't just a market street; it's an entire district dedicated to commerce. It's a maze of stalls, emporiums, auction houses, and guild halls from across the world. The air is thick with the smells of exotic spices, rare perfumes, and sizzling street food. While [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]] did take a toll on it, the community was quick to unite and rebuild it together. However, the markets are littered with thieves and angry merchants, and lost its comfort.

### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/Cindaland\|Cindaland]]**
The industrial, smog-choked heart of the city's manufacturing and manual labour. This is a district of constant noise, fire, and sweat. Home to blacksmiths, tinkerers, coopers, weavers, and other artisans. It's a gritty, blue-collar area where people work hard, drink harder, and are fiercely proud of their craft. As a result of its comfy location and strong population, Cindaland has surprisingly thrived after [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]]. What was a place only for the working man, is now a favourite spot for people to  find a warm hearth, a strong drink, and the unshakeable comfort of a community that stands together.

### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/Sunstone\|Sunstone]]**
A quiet, serene, and powerfully spiritual area dedicated to all different religious practices. Temples, shrines, monasteries, and sacred gardens dominate this peaceful, well-kept part of the city. It's a place of refuge, meditation, and political intrigue among the clergy. However, the peace is only surface-level; since [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]], theological disputes and covert wars between competing faiths can be fierce. Many people have become extremists, perceiving [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]] as a punishment from their deities. Now, [[The Citadel/Government/Military#**Policing & Internal Security The Vigiles and the Lictors**\|vigiles]] are spread around the district in an attempt to keep it safe.

### **[[The Citadel/Subcities/The Compound\|The Compound]]**
The fortified and exclusive enclave of the city's elite; aristocrats, high-ranking government officials, and the ultra-wealthy. This area is defined by its separation, both physical and social, from the common rabble. It is a world of manicured gardens, pristine manors, and silent, watchful guards where power is traded in whispers at glittering soir√©es and the law is a flexible tool for maintaining status quo. The compound was the first to be protected during [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]], and didn't really take a toll, however many of the people hate them now, and disrespect the wealthy when they try to go to other districts in the Citadel.
