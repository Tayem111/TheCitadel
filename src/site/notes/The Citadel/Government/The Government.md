[[The Citadel/Government/Governor Foley\|Governor Foley Woodspine]] didn’t trust kings, conquerors, or prophets - power, he knew, was a poison best diluted. So when he forged [[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]], he split authority into seven blades, each wielded by a different hand. No single voice could command absolute loyalty. No single faction could hoard all the gold, the soldiers, or the laws. Resources flowed like blood through a body - each organ demanding its share, each minister clawing for more, while Foley watched, sharp-eyed, from the shadows. The system was designed to balance… but balance, like a knife, cuts both ways

## Sovereign
The weight of leadership rests on the Sovereign’s shoulders, not as a tyrant, but as the steady hand guiding the ship of state. Their duty is to listen, to decide, and to act when the council’s voices clash. They are the final arbiter in disputes, the face of the nation in times of triumph and crisis, and the one who must answer when the people demand justice. Their ultimate goal? Not just to rule, but to balance: power against liberty, progress against tradition, ambition against wisdom

## Sentinel
War is not always on the horizon, but the Sentinel must always be watching. They command the armies, yes, but their true task is deeper, to foresee threats before they strike, to turn enemies into allies when possible, and to crush rebellion only when necessary. Their nightmare is not defeat in battle, but a nation unprepared. Their creed: _"Strength deters, but wisdom protects."_

## Scales
The law is a living thing, and the Scales must ensure it does not grow rotten. They oversee courts, punish corruption, and shield the weak from the powerful. But justice is more than punishment, it is _fairness_. Their battle is against bias, against cruelty disguised as order, against the slow erosion of rights. They do not make the laws, but they ensure the laws do not become chains.

## Harvestmaster
Gold and grain are the lifeblood of the realm, and the Harvestmaster ensures neither runs dry. They watch markets, break monopolies, and keep famine at bay. Their true skill? Turning scarcity into plenty. Through trade, through innovation, through the sweat of labourers and the cunning of merchants. A nation may survive without conquest, but it _starves_ without bread.

## Silver Tongue
Words are their weapons, treaties their battlefields. The Silver Tongue dances in the courts of foreign kings, spinning alliances from thin air and turning enemies into hesitant friends. But diplomacy is not just honeyed words, it is knowing when to flatter, when to threaten, and when to stay silent. One misstep could mean war. One masterstroke could bring an age of peace.

## Keeper
A nation is more than its borders, it is its stories, its faith, its dreams. The Keeper guards these things. They build schools, yes, but they also preserve ancient texts, mediate between priests and philosophers, and ensure that no voice, be it scholar, artist, or heretic, is silenced without cause. For when a people forget who they are, they become strangers in their own land.

## Stone Wright
While others debate laws and wars, the Stonewright _builds_. Roads, hospitals, aqueducts, these are the bones of civilisation. Plagues do not bow to kings, and floods do not respect borders. Their work is silent, but without it, the realm crumbles. They are the healer of the land itself, and their legacy is written not in books, but in the lives of those who never speak their name.
