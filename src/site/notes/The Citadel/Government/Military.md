[[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]] is not a kingdom of fluttering banners and chivalric romance. It is a nation forged from pragmatism and discipline, a fortress-state whose laws are its walls and its citizens are its garrison. Its power doesn't flow from the divine right of kings, but from the unbreakable will of the military.

### **The Feudal Structure: The Ladder of Merit**
[[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]] operates on a strict, merit-based hierarchy known as the Path of Offices. Status is earned, not inherited, though the Bateman family has held power since its creation as a result of their strict traditions, based in discipline and  have a significant advantage in educating their children for the path.

- **The Sentinel:** The ruler, often a former General. They hold the powers of supreme military command and ultimate judicial authority. Their word is law, but they are expected to listen to the Council of Tribunes.
- **The Equestrian Order:** The professional officer and administrative class. They are the engineers, logisticians, mid-level officers, and tax collectors. Membership is the goal for any commoner with ambition.
- **The Legionaries:** Full citizen-soldiers. Service in the Legion for 10 years grants a citizen a plot of land and a pension, and 40 years can get land in the inner compounds. They are the backbone of the state.
- **The Auxiliaries:** Non-citizens recruited from territories or allied travellers. They serve for 25 years to earn citizenship for themselves and their families. They fight in their traditional styles, giving [[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]] incredible tactical flexibility.

### **Military Strategies: The Unstoppable Phalanx**
[[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]]'s military doctrine is based on overwhelming discipline, engineering, and adaptability.

- **The Shield Wall (Testudo):** The iconic formation. Legionaries lock their large, tower shields to form an impregnable shell against arrows and spells from the front and above. They advance slowly, relentlessly, a tortoise of steel that cannot be stopped by conventional means.
- **Castramentation:** Every time a Legion force stops for more than a few hours, they build a fortified camp (_castrum_). With pre-measured stakes and a standardised plan, they can erect a wooden wall and a defensive ditch before sundown. This means they never sleep in undefended territory.
- **The Pilum Volley:** Their opening gambit. Legionaries hurl their heavy javelins (_pila_), designed to bend on impact. This isn't just to kill; it's to render enemy shields useless and break charges before they begin.
- **Adaptation:** [[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]] does not disdain the magic or tactics of its enemies. It subsumes them. Auxiliary mages are integrated into cohorts to provide counter-spells and artillery support. If they encounter a new monster, Legion strategists will devise a new formation and drill it relentlessly until it becomes standard procedure.

### **Policing & Internal Security: The Vigiles and the Lictors**
Order within [[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]]'s walls is maintained by two groups.

- **The Vigiles:** The night watch and fire brigade. They are a militia of lesser citizens and freedmen who patrol the streets, looking for crime, fire hazards, and seditious talk. They are not warriors, but they are numerous and have a keen eye for trouble.
- **The Lictors:** The true power within the city. These are experienced, retired Legion veterans who serve as magistrates, judges, and executioners. Each carries the _fasces_—a bundle of rods bound around a single axe. The rods symbolise the state's power to punish, and the axe its power to execute. They are incorruptible, feared, and utterly devoted to the law. To see a Lictor at your door is a sign that your life is forfeit.
