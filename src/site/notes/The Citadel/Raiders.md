### **Scratchers**
These are the most common Raiders, emaciated humanoids that move in skittering packs. Their skin is stretched tight over sharp bones, their colour is red and glistening, as if their skin is inside-out. They attack with frantic, clawing desperation, but their most distinctive feature is their faint, sizzling body heat and the faint, almost imperceptible smell of brimstone and burned hair that lingers for moments after they are slain.

### **Howlers**
Larger than a man and muscular, Howlers serve as pack leaders. Their faces are a distorted mockery of a hound or bull, with mouths that open too wide, lined with blackened, jagged teeth. Their roar is a deafening, guttural blast that seems to shred the fog around them. Those who have survived a Howler's cry up close report feeling not just sound, but a wave of blistering, dry heat that leaves the throat parched and the skin feeling sunburned.

### **Husk**
A terrifying, solitary predator. The Husk is a tall, skinny figure clothed in tattered rags that seem to bleed into the fog. Its face is forever hidden in shadow, but its hands are always visible, long-fingered, twitching, and ending in nails that are black and hardened. It doesn't bleed when cut, it weeps a thick, viscous fluid that smokes.

### **Amorphous**
A nightmarish entity with no fixed form, appearing as a rolling wave of black sludge, discarded rubble, and sharp, protruding bones. It moves silently, absorbing debris and the remains of its victims to add to its mass. Within its shifting form, one can sometimes glimpse brief, terrifying glimpses of what look like tormented, screaming faces.

### **Whisperers**
These Raiders are rarely seen, more often heard. They are slender, pale figures that drift through the deepest fog, their features blurred and indistinct. They do not attack physically. Instead, they seek to isolate the living and speak to them in a soft, compelling voice that seems to come from just behind the listener's ear. Their words are lies and despair, tailored to break the will. Those who resist their mental assaults report the voice carried a subtle sweetness, like honey.
