A combination of the tourists and travellers places and the agricultural and natural hub within the city walls. This district was dominated by massive greenhouses, terraced farms, and ranches, as well as inns, hotels and taverns. Alsace, however, did not fair well during [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]]. The [[The Citadel/Government/Military\|military]] failed to keep this area safe, and it was heavily destroyed, leaving a large part of it barren, and 'cursed', known now as [[The Citadel/Subcities/Alsace#**Ghost Town**\|Ghost Town]]. Now, Alsace fails to continue its agricultural practices, and has become ridden with crime.
