The centre of arcane learning, magical industry, and weird happenings. This district is where the city's wizards, alchemists, artificers, and scholars congregate. The architecture is strange, towers that defy gravity, buildings made of crystal or solidified light, and streets that sometimes change path. Magical mishaps are a daily occurrence. Or rather, it was like this. [[The Citadel/The Fall\|The Fall]] has left it less fantastical. Where magic was once used to beautify life, it is now needed for the population just to get by.
