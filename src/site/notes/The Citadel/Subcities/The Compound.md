The fortified and exclusive enclave of the city's elite; aristocrats, high-ranking government officials, and the ultra-wealthy. This area is defined by its separation, both physical and social, from the common rabble. It is a world of manicured gardens, pristine manors, and silent, watchful guards where power is traded in whispers at glittering soir√©es and the law is a flexible tool for maintaining status quo. The compound was the first to be protected during [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]], and didn't really take a toll, however many of the people hate them now, and disrespect the wealthy when they try to go to other districts in the Citadel.
