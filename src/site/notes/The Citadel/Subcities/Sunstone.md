A quiet, serene, and powerfully spiritual area dedicated to all different religious practices. Temples, shrines, monasteries, and sacred gardens dominate this peaceful, well-kept part of the city. It's a place of refuge, meditation, and political intrigue among the clergy. However, the peace is only surface-level; since [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]], theological disputes and covert wars between competing faiths can be fierce. Many people have become extremists, perceiving [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]] as a punishment from their deities. Now, [[The Citadel/Government/Military#**Policing & Internal Security The Vigiles and the Lictors**\|vigiles]] are spread around the district in an attempt to keep it safe.
