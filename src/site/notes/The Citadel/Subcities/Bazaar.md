The bustling, chaotic, and overwhelming mercantile and trade hub. This isn't just a market street; it's an entire district dedicated to commerce. It's a maze of stalls, emporiums, auction houses, and guild halls from across the world. The air is thick with the smells of exotic spices, rare perfumes, and sizzling street food. While [[The Citadel/The Fall\|the Fall]] did take a toll on it, the community was quick to unite and rebuild it together. However, the markets are littered with thieves and angry merchants, and lost its comfort.
