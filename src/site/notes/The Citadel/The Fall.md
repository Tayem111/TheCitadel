The Fall began not with a roar, but with a silent, creeping dread. A bank of thick, grey fog rolled in from eastern border, enveloping [[The Citadel/The Citadel\|The Citadel]] in a matter of hours. All attempts to scatter it magically or with wind failed. The fog carries a distinct scent of ash and smoke. Most terrifyingly, all methods of communication or scrying beyond the city limits ceased instantly and have not functioned since.

### **[[The Citadel/Raiders\|Raiders]]**
Within a number days of the fog's arrival, the first [[The Citadel/Raiders\|Raiders]] emerged. The Breach at [[The Citadel/Subcities/Alsace\|Alsace]]: The event that turned the tide from fear to outright panic. The initial attacks were chaotic and devastating due to the complete lack of preparedness. The first documented type was mindless, emaciated humanoids, with red oily skin, and dirty nails. They would brutally tear their victims to shreds, and thus were named [[The Citadel/Raiders#Scratchers\|Scratchers]].
The first year after The Fall is a chronicle of terror and loss. With no walls to hold them, Raiders ran rampant through the outer districts. The city's population was reduced by half through combination of slaughter, abduction, and desperate flight into the fog.
#### **[[Shield Force\|Shield Force]]**
Founded and commanded by [[Jannalor Waesnelis\|Jannalor Waesnelis]], the [[Shield Force\|Shield Force]] was a desperate emergency unit active after the Breach at [[The Citadel/Subcities/Alsace\|Alsace]]. While others built walls and fought off [[The Citadel/Raiders\|Raiders]], this mobile task force executed daring rescue operations into the overrun outer districts. Their sole mission was to save lives, fighting against the Raiders to carve out escape corridors and shepherd terrified citizens inward to safety.


Survival necessitated drastic action. Led by [[The Citadel/Government/Sisi Bateman\|Sisi Bateman]], the citizens undertook the difficult task of building a series of inner walls using scavenged material from lost districts. This project, which took a year to complete, defined the new, smaller borders of The Citadel and created the defensible fortress it is today. However, the loss still occurred, and no one could ever truly heal.
